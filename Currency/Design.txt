Made a dom with seperate style, so that in the future same style can be used aswell as the code looks cleaner.

I tried not to make too many different classes since it is a small project.
I use a little of MVC (model view controller) to try and seperate the responsibilities and not have everything all together
and reduce the tasks one class/file needs to do and for easier chage of code in the future.

I have not gotten to test, but will probably make unit test for the backend and database to check  if the data 
that is being (PUT) created in the database is the same data that is received(GET).

I also wanted to convert the currency but found out after that I did not have that access so only getting the currency names


For this to work:

I made the database in sql workbench so this has to be setup. right now the user is root with password kagemand and the database is called currency

For the backend I used dotnet so the code needs to be run with the dotnet run command.

Frontend needs to be hosted, I used the live server extension
